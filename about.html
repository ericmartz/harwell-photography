          Inspiration comes in so many forms. For me, I am inspired by art, different cultures, great food and faraway places.  However, my greatest inspiration on earth is my incredible family.
        </p>
          I am a father of three incredible kids and husband to an amazing, beautiful, incredibly supportive wife. I love just being with them, watching them grow, explore and love life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We moved from Manhattan to the Georgia countryside to experience Nature and a slower, more simple existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been in love with photography for a very long time. I started as a photojournalist for newspapers, moved on to Portrait Photography and then to Ralph Lauren where I spent 8 years working as Creative Director for New York stores.
          All these stops along the way taught me a great deal, and my style is a mix of all that I have experienced.  Like Tennyson said in Ulysses, "I am a part of all I have met."
        </p>
        <p>
          I absolutely LOVE what I do!  To be able to capture two people at one of the happiest times in their life, people who have found one another and chosen to spend the rest of their lives together, AWESOME!
        </p>
        <p>
          To have the opportunity to be a small part of their journey, and experience their love for each other is truly magic!
          I have been honored to have my weddings published in publications such as, Martha Stewart Wedding's, Geraldine Magazine, Inside Wedding's, The Knot Magazine, Bride's Magazine, Southern Weddings Magazine, Weddings Unveiled, and The New York Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was named as one of 69 of the World's Top Wedding Photographers by Martha Stewart Weddings, I was also named in 2012 as Photo District News "Rising Star of Wedding Photography."
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a Getty photographer and a member of Professional Photographers Of America and Wedding and Portrait Photographers International.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would be honored to be a part of your wedding day!
